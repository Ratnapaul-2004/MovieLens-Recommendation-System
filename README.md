- Collaborative Filtering:

  - User-based similarity using cosine similarity.

  - Matrix factorization using NMF.

- Content-Based Filtering:

  - TF-IDF vectorization of genres.

  - Cosine similarity to recommend similar movies.

- Hybrid System: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering.

- Evaluation Metrics:

  - RMSE & MAE for error measurement.

  - Precision@K to evaluate recommendation quality.
